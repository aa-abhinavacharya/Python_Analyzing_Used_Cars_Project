# Project :- Used cars analysis using Python

### Note :- All the files used for data analysis are present in the repository. Project is prepared with the help of the course in Udemy [Python Data Visualization: Matplotlib & Seaborn Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-pandas/) by Maven Analytics. Datasets are present in the link-[Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-visualization-matplotlib-seaborn/?srsltid=AfmBOop1YNPr3dWseg0L2AXe6v50HlWa4ne2Q7JMvhT3Fl-q7DuIaszj).

## Project Brief :- This project focused on delivering actionable insights to support a fleet management company facing vehicle supply shortages from traditional suppliers. The goal was to explore the automotive auction market as an alternative source, with a particular focus on locating cost-effective Ford F150 trucks.

## Objective Brief :-  To provide data-backed recommendations for diversifying procurement channels, minimizing vehicle acquisition costs, and ensuring fleet demand is met through alternative sourcing strategies.

## Objectives :- 

1. Read in and manipulate data with Pandas.

2. Build summary charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

3. Leverage Seaborn’s advanced chart types to mine insights from the data and make a decision.

## How the insights help us in smarter vehicle procurement ?

#### Market Alignment & Pricing Accuracy

A strong correlation between sellingprice and mmr confirms that market prices generally reflect expected values.

Trends by year, condition, and odometer validate that vehicle age and wear significantly impact price.

#### Brand & Model-Specific Value Retention

Brands like Toyota and BMW show stronger value retention compared to others, especially as odometer readings increase.

Ford F-150s show predictable pricing patterns, confirming their value in fleet operations.

#### Condition-Based Pricing Segmentation

Higher vehicle conditions correlate with higher prices, but certain condition bins may offer optimal value.

Understanding these patterns enables cost-efficient purchasing without sacrificing quality.

#### Regional and Visual Price Opportunities

Some states consistently offer vehicles (especially XLT models) below MMR, with good inventory levels.

Vehicle color also influences price deviation from MMR — certain colors may be less in demand and more affordable.

## How We Can Utilize These Findings:

#### Optimize Fleet Purchasing Strategy

Prioritize sourcing F-150s with condition ≥ 3.5 from regions with below-MMR pricing and high availability.

Focus on specific trims (like XLT) that offer the best value/features balance for work fleets.

#### Identify Undervalued Inventory

Use color, brand, and condition pricing patterns to find “hidden deals” in the market — vehicles selling below recommended value.

#### Negotiate with Data Confidence

Leverage insights on MMR deviation and market trends to justify offers and negotiate smarter at auctions or with resellers.

#### Support Long-Term Value Planning

Use odometer vs. price analysis by brand to plan resale timing and expected depreciation, boosting lifecycle profitability.

#### Develop Targeted Procurement Filters

Build sourcing tools or scripts that filter inventory by:

1. Make/Model = F-150

2. Condition ≥ 3.5

3. Price < MMR

4. Region = Top states for deals

5. Color = High value retention or lower price deviation
